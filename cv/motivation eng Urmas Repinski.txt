Hello,

The project I worked on at the Tallinn Technical University - Forensic - was in C++, a scientific project. Sufficient description in the Summary, link in English http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agra/eng/forensic.php

I have a home page on GitHub, fully functioning: https://urimus.wasmer.app/about_me_eng.html
The page is also a portfolio.

Basically, the page code consists of Html + JavaScript, a little PHP (does not work on GitHub). Each HTML page uses a script https://urimus.wasmer.app/scripts/pageResize.js
To display the Appearing Menu, the script https://urimus.wasmer.app/scripts/showMenu.js is used.

Sections you may be interested in:
1. Site Map - https://urimus.wasmer.app/index_eng.html?type=aboutme&sortby=name. JavaScript Code that makes this section work - https://urimus.wasmer.app/scripts/showContents.js

2. News - News Feed NASA - https://urimus.wasmer.app/news_eng.html?source=nasa&type=releases (also exists CBS, Yahoo! and Yonhap). Relevant Code - https://urimus.wasmer.app/scripts/showFeed.js. To read the Feed, the feednami library (https://toolkit.sekando.com/docs/en/feednami) is used, which runs on JavaScript.

3. The most voluminous section is the HTML editor, which allows you to modify the content of this site online directly from the same website. For the editor to work (https://urimus.wasmer.app/html_editor_eng.html?pattern=spec/mo*&i=0) PHP support and also a password are required; it does not function on GitHub, but the corresponding JavaScript files are required to work on server that supports PHP further:
a. https://urimus.wasmer.app/scripts/processSearchAndReplace.js
b. https://urimus.wasmer.app/scripts/functionsAndConstants.js

Also know C++, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, Css, MySQL well, and studying Python.

Thank you,
Urmas Repinski.
